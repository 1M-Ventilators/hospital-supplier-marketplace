# hospital-supplier-marketplace

Help connect hospitals that desperately need ventilators to the suppliers of these ventilators. Start by reading the Issues to see if you are able to comment on them. Not all issues are related to writing code. Most of them are related to information-sharing. This is a fast-evolving pandemic. Both time and information are of the essence. To start with, what should this app do? What are the minimum requirements it needs to be useful? 

Bear in mind that the global scale of this pandemic will require a good focus on internationalization and localization. Are you a translator? We will need you once the app is ready.
